# PLTPaperPlots
A repository for the plotting scripts and data for the PLT paper.

Ideally, this directory should contain the scripts and all necessary data needed to make each plot. If this is not possible for whatever reason, then it should at least contain the plot saved as a ROOT .C macro so that it can be easily changed as necessary.

* Fig. 11 (track luminosity comparison for one fill): PlotTrackLumiFillPaper.C, originally derived from PLTOffline/TrackLumi2020/PlotTrackLumiFill.C, which uses the data in TrackLumiData/ for fill 5019, also originally from that directory.

* Figs. 12 and 13 (track luminosity VdM results): PlotTrackLumiVdMPaper.C, originally derived from PLTOffline/TrackLumi2020/PlotTrackLumiVdM.C, which uses the data in TrackLumiData/ for fill 6016, also originally from the same directory.

* Fig. 16 (2015 alignment over time): PlotAlignmentVsTimePaper.C, originally derived from PLTOffline/plotScripts/PlotAlignmentVsTime.C, which uses the alignment data in Alignment2015/, originally from PLTOffline/ALIGNMENT.
